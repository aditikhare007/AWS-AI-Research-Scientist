### AWS Panorama ###

AWS Panorama is a collection of ML devices and software development kit (SDK) that brings computer vision (CV) to on-premises internet protocol (IP) cameras. With AWS Panorama, you can automate tasks that have traditionally required human inspection to improve visibility into potential issues.

Computer vision can automate visual inspection for tasks such as tracking assets to optimize supply chain operations, monitoring traffic lanes to optimize traffic management, or detecting anomalies to evaluate manufacturing quality. In environments with limited network bandwidth however, or for companies with data governance rules that require on-premises processing and storage of video, computer vision in the cloud can be difficult or impossible to implement. AWS Panorama is an ML service that allows organizations to bring computer vision to on-premises cameras to make predictions locally with high accuracy and low latency.

The AWS Panorama Appliance is a hardware device that adds computer vision to your existing IP cameras and analyzes the video feeds of multiple cameras from a single management interface. It generates predictions at the edge in milliseconds, meaning you can be notified about potential issues such as when damaged products are detected on a fast-moving production line, or when a vehicle has strayed into a dangerous off-limits zone in a warehouse. And, third-party manufacturers are building new AWS Panorama-enabled cameras and devices to provide even more form factors for your unique use cases. With AWS Panorama you can use ML models from AWS to build your own computer vision applications, or work with a partner from the AWS Partner Network to build CV applications quickly.

## Quantum technologies - Amazon Bracket ##

Amazon Braket is a fully managed quantum computing service that helps researchers and developers get started with the technology to accelerate research and discovery. Amazon Braket provides a development environment for you to explore and build quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit simulators, and run them on different quantum hardware technologies.

Quantum computing has the potential to solve computational problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers by harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics to process information in new ways. This approach to computing could transform areas such as chemical engineering, material science, drug discovery, financial portfolio optimization, and machine learning. But defining those problems and programming quantum computers to solve them requires new skills, which are difficult to acquire without easy access to quantum computing hardware.

Amazon Braket overcomes these challenges so you can explore quantum computing. With Amazon Braket, you can design and build your own quantum algorithms from scratch or choose from a set of pre-built algorithms. Once you have built your algorithm, Amazon Braket provides a choice of simulators to test, troubleshoot and run your algorithms. When you are ready, you can run your algorithm on your choice of different quantum computers, and gate-based computers from Rigetti and IonQ. With Amazon Braket, you can now evaluate the potential of quantum computing for your organization, and build expertise.

## Robotics - AWS RoboMaker ##

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/robotics.html

AWS RoboMaker is a service that makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy intelligent robotics applications at scale. AWS RoboMaker extends the most widely used open-source robotics software framework, Robot Operating System (ROS), with connectivity to cloud services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. AWS RoboMaker provides a robotics development environment for application development, a robotics simulation service to accelerate application testing, and a robotics fleet management service for remote application deployment, update, and management.

Robots are machines that sense, compute, and take action. Robots need instructions to accomplish tasks, and these instructions come in the form of applications that developers code to determine how the robot will behave. Receiving and processing sensor data, controlling actuators for movement, and performing a specific task are all functions that are typically automated by these intelligent robotics applications. Intelligent robots are being increasingly used in warehouses to distribute inventory, in homes to carry out tedious housework, and in retail stores to provide customer service. Robotics applications use machine learning in order to perform more complex tasks like recognizing an object or face, having a conversation with a person, following a spoken command, or navigating autonomously.

Until now, developing, testing, and deploying intelligent robotics applications was difficult and time consuming. Building intelligent robotics functionality using machine learning is complex and requires specialized skills. Setting up a development environment can take each developer days and building a realistic simulation system to test an application can take months due to the underlying infrastructure needed. Once an application has been developed and tested, a developer needs to build a deployment system to deploy the application into the robot and later update the application while the robot is in use.

AWS RoboMaker provides you with the tools to make building intelligent robotics applications more accessible, a fully managed simulation service for quick and easy testing, and a deployment service for lifecycle management. AWS RoboMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of robotics development so you can focus on creating innovative robotics applications.

## Satellite - AWS Ground Station ##

AWS Ground Station

AWS Ground Station is a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data, and scale your satellite operations quickly, easily and cost-effectively without having to worry about building or managing your own ground station infrastructure. Satellites are used for a wide variety of use cases, including weather forecasting, surface imaging, communications, and video broadcasts. Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antennas to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downloaded, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellites.

AWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a global ground station as a service. We provide direct access to AWS services and the AWS Global Infrastructure including our low-latency global fiber network right where your data is downloaded into our AWS Ground Station. This enables you to easily control satellite communications, quickly ingest and process your satellite data, and rapidly integrate that data with your applications and other services running in the AWS Cloud. For example, you can use Amazon S3 to store the downloaded data, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for managing data ingestion from satellites, SageMaker for building custom machine learning applications that apply to your data sets, and Amazon EC2 to command and download data from satellites. AWS Ground Station can help you save up to 80% on the cost of your ground station operations by allowing you to pay only for the actual antenna time used, and relying on our global footprint of ground stations to download data when and where you need it, instead of building and operating your own global ground station infrastructure. There are no long-term commitments, and you gain the ability to rapidly scale your satellite communications on-demand when your business needs it.
